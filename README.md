# Portfolio Website

## Overview

This project is a dynamic and interactive portfolio website meticulously crafted to showcase my software development skills and a range of projects. It serves as a personal platform to demonstrate my passion for bringing my ideas to life through code.

The website luses a modern technology stack, primarily featuring **React** for a component-based architecture, **Node.js** for potential backend functionalities, and **JavaScript** as the core programming language. To make the website visually interesting I leveraged **Three.js** for 3D graphics, and  **Tailwind CSS** for appeal and responsiveness.
