# Portfolio Website
Dynamic Portfolio Website using React, Node.js, and JavaScript. 
This website serves as a platform to showcase myself as a developer. 
By applying advanced web technologies, including
Three.js for 3D graphics, I am able to create an engaging and visually appealing experience. 
The use of Tailwind CSS ensured a modern design and responsiveness across various devices.
